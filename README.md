# Third-person Fighting

Hawt Dawg Man: Mustard Party 2 is a mobile game originally implemented in The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit.    
Chris Eriksen, the main character, can play it on his father's phone during the gameplay.

As a big fan of the Life is Strange game series, I decided to create the most similar clone of Mustard Party 2 using Unity, implementing all the main mechanics.    
Hope I succeded.

## Task

Create a small fighting game with a 3rd person camera view.

- Movement: WASD    
- Pick up an item: E    
- Drop the item: Q    
- Fight: Left click    
- Block: Right click    
- Switch between inventory items.    
- Put 3 fighting items on the map, each item should have it's own fighting animation.    
- Player can roam around the map and pick up these items to use.    
- Create an enemy. The enemy should have a radius of a couple of meters
for seeing the player. When the enemy sees the player it starts chasing
him and when it approaches the player close enough it starts fighting
him.    
- The enemy and and the player should have life bars, each equipped item
should have different hit points when in use.    

[ADDITIONAL TASKS REGARDING INTERNSHIP]

- ANY WEAPON SHOULD BE RANGED, WHICH MEANS YOU SHOULD MAKE 3 DIFFERENT
RANGED WEAPONS (HANDGUNS, ASSAULT RIFLES, GRENADE LAUNCHER, FOR EXAMPLE).
